    <h1>Andrew L. Riker</h1>
    <h2>1905 - 1907 SAE President</h2>
    
      <p>Widely known as an inventor and producer of electric cars and commercial trucks, Andrew L. Riker is also known as the first President of SAE International. In 1896, when Riker was 28 years old, he built an electric tricycle that he used for two years. In 1898, B. Altman and Company was the first department store in the United States to use an electric delivery wagon, which came from Riker Electric Motor Co. and had a range of 25-30 miles before needing charged. Soon after, Riker sold his company, concluding that the future of the automobile industry belonged to gasoline and joined forces with Locomobile Company of America to begin to design gasoline-powered automobiles. It was January 1905 in New York that the original founding members of SAE International assembled and elected its officers; Riker became President with Henry Ford as the first Vice President. During his three years in office, membership doubled and the first volume of SAE Transactions printed with three papers.</p>
